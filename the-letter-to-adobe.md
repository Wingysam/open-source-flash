Dear Adobe,

Flash and Shockwave have not only shaped the web into what it is today, but also affected so many areas we couldn't even imagine before. Animations, gaming, broadcasting, advertising, music, arts, programming. The list is long.

Open sourcing Flash and Shockwave would be a decent thing to do. We don't want to see a big portion of internet history vanish. The internet represents the whole world and initiatives like the Internet Archive are important, but powerless without having open formats.

There are many projects going on to preserve Flash and Shockwave content, which would benefit from open sourcing. We know you can't open source everything. You may withhold such parts and provide a note of what's missing. We know that a few parts have already been open sourced, but Flash and Shockwave remain proprietary formats.

Please see our open sourced petition and help us to preserve internet history: https://github.com/pakastin/open-source-flash

Yours truly,

Friends of Flash and Shockwave
